# Write-up Guidelines

These guidelines ensure consistent, clear, and concise challenge write-ups.

## 1. Setup & Template Adherence

-   **Start with `template.md`:** Copy `template.md` to your challenge directory (`challenges/<category>/<ChallengeName>/`) and rename it to `README.md`.
-   **Follow Structure:** Adhere strictly to the structure, headings, and formatting of `template.md`.

## 2. Content Creation

-   **Fill Placeholders:** Replace all bracketed placeholders `[ ]` with accurate, challenge-specific information.
-   **Challenge Description:** Provide a concise overview of the challenge and its objective.
-   **Vulnerability Summary:** Clearly explain the vulnerability, its identification, and confirmation.
-   **Solution Details:**
    -   **Initial Detection:** Detail the initial detection, including payload, expected output, and observation.
    -   **Exploitation Steps:** Provide a chronological walkthrough of the exploitation, including commands, code, output, and supporting screenshots.
-   **Flag:** Insert the exact flag obtained.
-   **Tools Used:** List all essential tools.

## 3. Image Handling

-   **Placement:** Place all images within the challenge directory.
-   **Naming:** Name images sequentially in the order they appear in the document (e.g., `image1.png`, `image2.png`, etc.).
-   **Integration:** Integrate relevant screenshots at their designated locations to visually explain steps. The flag screenshot belongs under the `## 3. Flag` section.

## 4. Quality Control

-   **Conciseness:** Provide only essential information. Avoid verbose explanations or unnecessary details.
-   **Accuracy:** Ensure all data, commands, and flags are accurate and verified. Do not use fake or speculative data.
-   **No Junk:** Do not include placeholder comments, random text, or irrelevant information in the final write-up.
-   **Clarity:** Maintain clarity throughout the write-up.
